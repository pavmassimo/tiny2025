                            We are glad to announce the <strong>Special Session on Tiny Machine Learning</strong>, to be held in Yokohama, Japan in WCCI 2024. 
                            <!-- Both the workshop and the main conference will run in hybrid mode, with the possibility to attend in person or remotely. -->

                        <p>
                            The computing everywhere paradigm is paving the way for the pervasive diffusion of tiny devices 
                            (such as Internet-of-things or edge computing devices) endowed with intelligent abilities. 
                            Achieving this goal requires machine and deep learning solutions to be completely redesigned to 
                            fit the severe technological constraints on computation, memory, and power consumption typically 
                            characterizing these tiny devices. This is exactly where Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) comes 
                            into play. TinyML is a new and promising area of Machine Learning aimed at designing and developing
                            Machine and Deep Learning solutions that can be executed on tiny devices.

                            <br><br>
                            This special session aims at exploring the latest advancements, models, algorithms, methodologies, and applications in TinyML. 

                        </p>

                            Even though machine learning (ML) algorithms are reaching surprising results in various research fields, they still have limitations when facing specific problems, especially when they are black boxes. Notably, data-driven models have met with limited success in many scientific domains. This is due to their large data requirements, inability to produce physically consistent results, and lack of generalizability to out-of-sample scenarios. Instead of a purely data-driven approach that ignores decades (sometimes centuries) of accumulated knowledge in the science domains, there is an increasing interest in Knowledge Guided Machine Learning (KGML) approaches to integrate such knowledge into the ML models. This goal can also be addressed by leveraging insights and methods from the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) field.
                            <br>
                            The popularity and success of ML-based systems has put issues such as explainability, bias, fairness, and sustainability. Addressing these issues naturally leads to systems in which domain knowledge and symbolic representations play a central role. On the other hand, ML also offers solutions for long-standing challenges in the field of KR, for instance related to efficient, neurally-guided, noise-tolerant and ampliative inference, knowledge acquisition, and the limitations of symbolic representations. The synergy between ML and KR has the potential to lead to new advancements in fundamental AI challenges including, but not limited to, learning symbolic generalizations from raw (multi-modal) data, using knowledge to facilitate data-efficient learning, speeding up inference, supporting interpretability of learned outcomes and integration of symbolic planning and reinforcement learning.
                            <br><br>
                            The workshop aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a dedicated forum for discussing new ideas and research results at the intersection of machine learning and knowledge representation.

                                                <em>When introducing neurosymbolic integration to researchers, one is often met with the question: “But why bother? Can’t I just machine learn it?”. Surprisingly often – particularly, when considering the current popularity of ML (and particularly DL) in academic research and the popular press – the answer is “No, you can’t.”. In this talk, we will have a look at the main motivation(s) for why integrating between symbolic and subsymbolic computation is often desirable, if not unavoidable. We will have a look at several use cases (taken from a variety of domains ranging from biomedical research to multisensory perception and context-adaptive robot control) which as of today appear to be almost impossible to solve without making recourse to both ML- and logic-based approaches. We will identify some of the reasons why a combination between data and knowledge is required, and will consider some of the most common ways of how to combine symbolic and subsymbolic aspects in solving the corresponding challenges.</em>
